				<p>Kraftwerk (German: [ˈkʁaftvɛɐ̯k], "power station") is a German band formed in Düsseldorf in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider.[5] Widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of electronic music, they were among the first successful acts to popularize the genre.[6] The group began as part of West Germany's experimental krautrock scene in the early 1970s before embracing electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers, drum machines, vocoders, and self-made instruments, in the middle of the decade. On commercially successful albums such as Autobahn (1974),
				Trans-Europe Express (1977), and The Man-Machine (1978), Kraftwerk developed a self-described "robot pop" style that combined electronic music with pop melodies, sparse arrangements, and repetitive rhythms, while adopting a stylized image including matching suits.
