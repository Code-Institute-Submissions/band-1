# Kraftwerk website
- For fans and other people interested in music, who want to find useful information & content about creators of modern electronic sound
 
## UX
- I had to take minimalistic approach when building this project because members of Kraftwerk almost always refuse to grant interviews, publicise their work, or to have photographs taken. except when they have new product to promote. Throughout their career they have refused big-name collaborations with the likes of David Bowie and Micheal Jackson. They haven't released a "best of" record and they're not celebrities or rock stars. They refuse to appear on chat shows or entertainment programmes. So I had only handful of materials I could use.
- Primary target audiences are fans and potential fans
- User Stories I used as guidelines
  - As a fan, I want to see clips from back catalog or any new material as it becomes available
  - As a fan, I want to listen to songs from Kraftwerk's back catalog
  - As a fan, I want to get latest news about the band
  - As a fan, I want to have an access to any new material as it becomes available
  - As a band, we want to showcase our music
  - As a band, we want to publicise our tour dates
